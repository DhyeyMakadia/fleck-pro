## Introduction:
Nowadays, people need to store their Sensitive Data like Documents for their verification purpose, Job-stuff, Project Details of students etc... in their PC/Laptop which they do not want to share with others. So the purpose of this Software is simply and completely based on securing their Data using Data Hiding Algorithms protected by a Password and an PIN. Basically this software makes it difficult for the Intruder to get access to your Data by any kind of means or path in the PC/Laptop. (For Windows OS only)

## Setup:
1. Running the Software for the First time, asks you for registering a New User Password and PIN.
2. After that every time you Run the Software it will ask you for the Password and PIN to get access.
3. List of Options:

a. When you Run the Software for the First time, a new LOCKER Folder is made in the same directory. Place all the sensitive/private files in the LOCKER Folder created outside and then use the LOCK THE FOLDER option so the Software will hide the Folder itself and all the Content (Files & Folders) present inside.

b. Secondly, when you want to Restore your Data then use UNLOCK THE FOLDER option and so your Data and the LOCKER Folder will be restored in it’s original form.

c. In Future, if you want to change your Password or PIN or both then you can use the CHANGE YOUR PASSWORD Option and repeat the Step-1.

d. IV.	If you want to make a Zip File for all your Data then you can use the MAKE A ZIP FILE Option which will create a Zip File containing all the Data in the LOCKER Folder with inbuilt Password same as your User Password you’ve entered.
(7-Zip must be installed and given access to the Path to use this Feature. Also it is necessary that the Data must be Unlocked before using this Feature.) 

e. If at any point of time you want to remove the Software then you can use the REMOVE THE SOFTWARE Option.

## Special Note:

Under no circumstances shall we be liable or responsible to you or any other person for any damages, loss of any of your useful data by using this Software.
